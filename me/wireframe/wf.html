  <h1>Retro Restaurant Website Idea!</h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    My website will be a retro website.

    My site is for anyone wishing to get the 90s computer experience or feel nostalgic.
    It’s also for myself and for fun.  I want to get more javascript experience and do cool things with the design.
    It’ll be a little like my research websites, with the pop-ups looking like old computer windows.
    It’ll also have flashing comic sans text, cheesy keyboard music, scrolling marquees across the top, mouse trails, and 90s gifs like MC hammer dancing.
    I also want to do the old fashioned mouse icon and the grey looking windows and buttons.
    I want to include pixellated snow falling in the background like old cheesy myspace themes.

    As for the content I will make a hard-to-navigate to about page.
    I will also include a (somewhat hidden) 90s meme and gif page.
    Then the rest of the site will be a fake restaurant page.
    Complete with a menu, hours, fake testimonials,
    a meet the staff page (with pictures of barbie dolls and animals).

        This site is very cool and unique.  Though it is very advanced and can
        do a lot of things I will just be using it for design reference.

      <p>This website is great from the comic sans, to the scrolling text. 10/10.

        This website has cool design with the music and

        a nice, basic retro website.  The pixellated art and 90s feel.
