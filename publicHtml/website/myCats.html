        <h2>My Cats</h2>
        I have two beautiful cats.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3 class="lsTitle">Yoshi</h3>
            <div class='info'>
              <div>
                <br/>
                  <img src='./yoshisparkle.jpg' width="200px">
                <br/>
              </div>
              <div class='exp'>
                <p>
                  Yoshi is the sweetest cat ever.  Besides being totally adorable, she loves to play and cuddle.
                    She will always come and sleep next to me and lay on my chest.  She is very vocal and will whine frequently
                    when she doesn't get the attention she wants.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3 class="lsTitle">Leo</h3>
            <div class='info'>
              <div>
                <br/>
                  <img src='./leoAndMe.jpg' width="200px">
                <br/>
              </div>
              <div class='exp'>
                <p>
                  Leo is also a nice cat.  She is a tortoiseshell cat with interesting markings.
                  Even though she is shyer than Yoshi she still likes to cuddle and talk in little chirps from time to time.
                    I found Leo living outside the back of my house in Utah nearly starving to death.  She didn't
                  have any claws and she was already spayed.  Based on her behavior I think she might
                  have been abused.  Poor kitty.  I love her!
