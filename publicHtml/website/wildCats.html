                  Lions live in the savannah, and eat many wild animals,
                  including gazelles, zebras, and giraffes. However, giraffes will often
                  kick lions in the head with their giant legs.  Lions live in groups called Prides, which often consist
                  of one male and many females and children. If you like lions, you should watch
                  <i>The Lion King</i> made by Disney.  It is both a musical and an animated movie!
                   It has many fun songs, such as "I just can't wait to be king".

                  Panthers live in the jungle, and also eat many wild animals.  Panthers usually live in solitude,
                  sleeping in trees and blending in with their surroundings.
                    They usually have black fur.  They also like to swim.  If you like panthers, you should watch
                  <i>The Jungle Book</i> made by Disney.  It is both a live action and an animated movie!
                   Watch a clip!
